# EASY TO REMEMBER NOTES

**DOM SECTION**

**(a)Selectors**

```sh
Main Modules(topics)
  (i)document.getElementById()
  (ii)document.getElementsByClassName()
  (iii)document.getElementsByTagName()
  (iv)document.querySelector()
  (v)document.querySelectorAll()

```

```sh
Important notes

(a)changing content and styles via these selectors

```

**(b)Travesing**

```sh
Parents and Children(
  and element inside a div is a child whereas div is a Parent.
  Elements at the same level and are both children are siblings
)
```

```sh
Querying Parents children and Siblings
```

```sh
Parent node(Parent is where a certain Node Element is contained)

(a)Parent Node
(b)Child Node
(c)Children
(d)NextSibling
(e)Previous Sibling
(f)Previous Element Sibling
(g)Inseriting into the DOM(Inserting Before)

```

**Higer Order methods**

```
(a)foreach
(b)filer
(c)Map
(d)Sort
(e)Reduce


all the higher order Methods can be combined together

```

**ASTNCHRONOUSJAVASCRIPT**

```
Asynchronous means something is going on but you do not want to wait until it is
done to conitunue your program
```

```
You exectue the call back within the main exection time when using callback functions.

You can pass a function as a parameter within another function.

```

```
Synchronous programming means you have to wait until a process is completely finished before you move on.
```

```

(a)Callbacks
(b)Promises
(c)Async Await
```

```
Promises take in two parameters which are resolve and reject ..

if resolve -> .then()

else error -> .catch()

Promise .all()  is used when you have many promises.

Promises take however long the execution time of the latest promises..

All the promies are handled within the major execution time to show us the values.


fetch api employs two .thens
```

```
Async await is a more elegant way to handle promises.

```

**Conclusion**

```sh
Mbugua Caleb...Wow.I Love Javascript
A "node", in this context, is simply an HTML element. The "DOM" is a tree structure that represents the HTML of the website, and every HTML element is a "node".
