**Something about Javascript**

```
In javascript you can call methods even to strings
eg uppercase methods.
It adds wrapper to the strings making them behave somehow like classes.

```

**Object Literals**

```
this key word refers to that particular object whenever it is used from within that object.
An object literal in javascript is like a dictionary in python .

```

**Constructors**

```
Constructors help  you instantiate as many objects (object literals) without you having to repeat your code.

It just line a normal function thus helps you create as many dynamic objects and object literals.

Classes are more powerful than methods {are also derived along the same lines}..since they can take in a mumber of methods..
Methods in a class take in an instance variable from that specific class.
Instead of writing  a method from within a constructor...It is well advisable that you create
a prototype method....

```

**Prototpyes**

```
It is particulary a good standard to have prototypes from within your code.
These are in many times mothods...and its a good practice defining them as props rather than in your construcor function.

You may even set class attributes via the constructor method.
