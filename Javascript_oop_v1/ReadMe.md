**Comparison Bewtweeen ES5 AND ES6 CLASSES**

```
For es5 object oriented programmming in mostly comprised of a constructor function that makes up the object...as well as prototype methods instead of calling methods at the constructor level.

ES5 also has got the object create which is another way you can instantiate an object.

```

**OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING**

```
It is all about creating objects...

making a class which is a template of an object is one of them...

Another is object literals..

Another is Object create.

Classes in javascript were introduced in ES6.


```

**ES6 VS ES5**

```
ES6 classes compared to ES5 automatically maps the protyotype methods...

Works more efficiently when compared to ES5 where you have to link the code.

ES6 DOES Exactly what ES5 has been doing but under the hood...this easier way of writing code is called syntatic sugars


```

**Constructor**

```
A constructor is very important when you are creating a dynamic object.


```

**Something about Javascript**

```
In javascript you can call methods even to strings
eg uppercase methods.
It adds wrapper to the strings making them behave somehow like classes.

```

**Object Literals**

```
this key word refers to that particular object whenever it is used from within that object.
An object literal in javascript is like a dictionary in python .

```

**ES6 SUBCLASSES**

```
Extend is used.
When you call the super ...you are calling the parent class and inheriting from it...

any instance variable which is not in the super class must be referenced by this.

Using sub classes is easier than using inherictance is ES5...


```

**Static Methods**

```
These refer to methods in your class which you can use without instantiating an object.
```

**Constructors**

```
Constructors help  you instantiate as many objects (object literals) without you having to repeat your code.

It just line a normal function thus helps you create as many dynamic objects and object literals.

Classes are more powerful than methods {are also derived along the same lines}..since they can take in a mumber of methods..
Methods in a class take in an instance variable from that specific class.
Instead of writing  a method from within a constructor...It is well advisable that you create
a prototype method....

```

**Prototpyes**

```
It is particulary a good standard to have prototypes from within your code.
These are in many times mothods...and its a good practice defining them as props rather than in your constructor function.

You may even set class attributes via the constructor method.
